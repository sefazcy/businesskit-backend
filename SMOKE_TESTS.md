# Smoke Tests — BusinessKit Backend

Manual regression checklist. Run after any significant change or before
tagging a release. A fresh JWT is required for all admin checks — obtain one

## Payments (v4.5 — Public Checkout Prep)

### POST /api/payments/checkout — create checkout session

**Setup:** ensure appointment #N exists with a `BusinessServiceId` that has `Price > 0`.

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": N }` → 200, response contains:
  - `paymentId` (integer)
  - `appointmentId` (integer, equals N)
  - `amount` (decimal, equals service price)
  - `currency` (string, matches BusinessSettings.Currency or "TRY" if none set)
  - `status` = `"Pending"`
  - `provider` = `"Manual"`
  - `checkoutUrl` = `"http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}"`
  - `message` = `"Checkout session created. Awaiting payment."`

**Idempotency check:**

- [ ] Call `POST /api/payments/checkout` a second time with the same `appointmentId` → 200, same `paymentId` returned, `message` = `"Pending payment already exists for this appointment."`, no duplicate payment created
- [ ] Verify via `GET /api/admin/payments?appointmentId=N` that only one Pending payment record exists

**Error cases:**

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": 0 }` → 400 (validation error — appointmentId must be ≥ 1)
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with missing `appointmentId` field → 400 (ModelState validation)
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": 99999 }` (non-existent appointment) → 404
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` for an appointment that has **no service** (BusinessServiceId is null) → 400 with message about missing service
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` for an appointment whose service has `Price = 0` → 400 with message about price

**Already-paid case:**

- [ ] Simulate the payment as Paid (via `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` or admin mark-paid), then call `POST /api/payments/checkout` again for the same appointment → 400 with message `"Appointment already has a completed payment. No new checkout session can be created."`

---

### GET /api/payments/{id}/status — unchanged, verify still safe

- [ ] After creating a checkout session, `GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status` → 200
- [ ] Response contains exactly: `id`, `status`, `paidAt` — **no** notes, failureReason, provider, customerId, checkoutUrl, or amount
- [ ] Unknown payment id → 404

---

### PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid — dev simulation endpoint

- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment is Pending → 200, returns full PaymentDto with status `"Paid"` and `paidAt` set
- [ ] Notification created: admin notifications list shows "Payment received" entry for this payment
- [ ] If appointment has a `CustomerEmail`, a payment confirmation email is attempted (check logs — non-critical if email not configured)
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment is already Paid → 400 with transition error message
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment id doesn't exist → 404

---

### Admin visibility

- [ ] After `POST /api/payments/checkout` creates a payment, `GET /api/admin/payments` (with token) shows the new Pending payment in the list
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/{paymentId}` (with token) → 200, full PaymentDto including `providerCheckoutUrl` = `"http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}"`
- [ ] Admin panel → Payments page shows the new payment with status badge "Pending"
- [ ] After `simulate-paid`, admin Payments page shows updated status badge "Paid" and paidAt timestamp

---

### Full end-to-end flow (Swagger walkthrough)

1. **Pick or create an appointment with a service:**
   - Use an existing appointment or `POST /api/appointments` with a valid `businessServiceId`
   - Note the `appointmentId`

2. **Create checkout session:**
   ```
   POST /api/payments/checkout
   Body: { "appointmentId": <id> }
   ```
   - Expect 200 with `paymentId`, `checkoutUrl`, `status: "Pending"`

3. **Verify idempotency:**
   ```
   POST /api/payments/checkout
   Body: { "appointmentId": <same id> }
   ```
   - Expect same `paymentId`, message confirms existing payment found

4. **Poll payment status (as PublicSite would):**
   ```
   GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status
   ```
   - Expect `status: "Pending"`, `paidAt: null`

5. **Simulate payment success:**
   ```
   PATCH /api/payments/{paymentId}/simulate-paid
   ```
   - Expect 200 with `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` set

6. **Poll status again:**
   ```
   GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status
   ```
   - Expect `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` is set

7. **Verify in admin:**
   ```
   GET /api/admin/payments?appointmentId=<id>   (with token)
   ```
   - Expect one payment record with status `Paid`
