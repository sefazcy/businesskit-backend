# Smoke Tests — BusinessKit Backend

Manual regression checklist. Run after any significant change or before
tagging a release. A fresh JWT is required for all admin checks — obtain one

## Payments (v4.5 — Public Checkout Prep)

### POST /api/payments/checkout — create checkout session

**Setup:** ensure appointment #N exists with a `BusinessServiceId` that has `Price > 0`.

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": N }` → 200, response contains:
  - `paymentId` (integer)
  - `appointmentId` (integer, equals N)
  - `amount` (decimal, equals service price)
  - `currency` (string, matches BusinessSettings.Currency or "TRY" if none set)
  - `status` = `"Pending"`
  - `provider` = `"Manual"`
  - `checkoutUrl` = `"http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}"`
  - `message` = `"Checkout session created. Awaiting payment."`

**Idempotency check:**

- [ ] Call `POST /api/payments/checkout` a second time with the same `appointmentId` → 200, same `paymentId` returned, `message` = `"Pending payment already exists for this appointment."`, no duplicate payment created
- [ ] Verify via `GET /api/admin/payments?appointmentId=N` that only one Pending payment record exists

**Error cases:**

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": 0 }` → 400 (validation error — appointmentId must be ≥ 1)
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with missing `appointmentId` field → 400 (ModelState validation)
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with `{ "appointmentId": 99999 }` (non-existent appointment) → 404
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` for an appointment that has **no service** (BusinessServiceId is null) → 400 with message about missing service
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` for an appointment whose service has `Price = 0` → 400 with message about price

**Already-paid case:**

- [ ] Simulate the payment as Paid (via `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` or admin mark-paid), then call `POST /api/payments/checkout` again for the same appointment → 400 with message `"Appointment already has a completed payment. No new checkout session can be created."`

---

### GET /api/payments/{id}/status — unchanged, verify still safe

- [ ] After creating a checkout session, `GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status` → 200
- [ ] Response contains exactly: `id`, `status`, `paidAt` — **no** notes, failureReason, provider, customerId, checkoutUrl, or amount
- [ ] Unknown payment id → 404

---

### PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid — dev simulation endpoint

- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment is Pending → 200, returns full PaymentDto with status `"Paid"` and `paidAt` set
- [ ] Notification created: admin notifications list shows "Payment received" entry for this payment
- [ ] If appointment has a `CustomerEmail`, a payment confirmation email is attempted (check logs — non-critical if email not configured)
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment is already Paid → 400 with transition error message
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` where payment id doesn't exist → 404

---

### Admin visibility

- [ ] After `POST /api/payments/checkout` creates a payment, `GET /api/admin/payments` (with token) shows the new Pending payment in the list
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/{paymentId}` (with token) → 200, full PaymentDto including `providerCheckoutUrl` = `"http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}"`
- [ ] Admin panel → Payments page shows the new payment with status badge "Pending"
- [ ] After `simulate-paid`, admin Payments page shows updated status badge "Paid" and paidAt timestamp

---

### Full end-to-end flow (Swagger walkthrough)

1. **Pick or create an appointment with a service:**
   - Use an existing appointment or `POST /api/appointments` with a valid `businessServiceId`
   - Note the `appointmentId`

2. **Create checkout session:**
   ```
   POST /api/payments/checkout
   Body: { "appointmentId": <id> }
   ```
   - Expect 200 with `paymentId`, `checkoutUrl`, `status: "Pending"`

3. **Verify idempotency:**
   ```
   POST /api/payments/checkout
   Body: { "appointmentId": <same id> }
   ```
   - Expect same `paymentId`, message confirms existing payment found

4. **Poll payment status (as PublicSite would):**
   ```
   GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status
   ```
   - Expect `status: "Pending"`, `paidAt: null`

5. **Simulate payment success:**
   ```
   PATCH /api/payments/{paymentId}/simulate-paid
   ```
   - Expect 200 with `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` set

6. **Poll status again:**
   ```
   GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status
   ```
   - Expect `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` is set

7. **Verify in admin:**
   ```
   GET /api/admin/payments?appointmentId=<id>   (with token)
   ```
   - Expect one payment record with status `Paid`

---

## Payments (v4.7 — simulate-paid environment gating)

### PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid — Development only

**In Development environment (`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`):**

- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` for a Pending payment → 200, returns full PaymentDto with `status: "Paid"` and `paidAt` set
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` for a Paid payment → 400 with transition error message (existing behavior)
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` for a non-existent id → 404 with `{ message: "Payment with id X was not found." }`

**In non-Development environments (Staging, Production, etc.):**

- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` → 404 (plain, no body) — the endpoint appears not to exist
- [ ] The payment record is NOT modified (payment remains Pending) — verify via admin GET after the call
- [ ] No error details, internal state, or provider information are exposed

**Unchanged endpoints (must still work in all environments):**

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with valid `appointmentId` → 200, checkout session created
- [ ] `GET /api/payments/{id}/status` → 200, returns `id`, `status`, `paidAt` only
- [ ] Both endpoints work with no `Authorization` header

---

## Business Settings (v4.9 — currency validation)

### PUT /api/admin/business-settings — currency field

**Valid currencies (case-insensitive input, stored as uppercase):**

- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "TRY"` (with full valid body) → 200, response `currency` = `"TRY"`
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "USD"` → 200, response `currency` = `"USD"`
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "EUR"` → 200, response `currency` = `"EUR"`
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "GBP"` → 200, response `currency` = `"GBP"`
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "try"` (lowercase) → 200, response `currency` = `"TRY"` (normalized)
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "  usd  "` (with whitespace) → 200, response `currency` = `"USD"` (trimmed + normalized)

**Invalid currencies:**

- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "USDEWQ"` → 400, response body contains `"Currency must be one of: TRY, USD, EUR, GBP."`
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": "JPY"` → 400, same error message
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` with `"currency": ""` (empty string) → 400 (fails `[Required]` or `[AllowedCurrency]`)
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/business-settings` without `currency` field → 400 (missing required field)
- [ ] No payment record is modified when settings update fails

**GET endpoint unchanged:**

- [ ] `GET /api/business-settings` → 200 (or 404 if never set), currency reflects the stored value
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/business-settings` with token → same

---

### Checkout — stale invalid currency in DB

If `BusinessSettings.Currency` contains an old invalid value (e.g., `"USDEWQ"` stored before v4.9):

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with a valid `appointmentId` → 200, response `currency` = `"TRY"` (safe fallback applied)
- [ ] The checkout does NOT return an error due to the stale DB value
- [ ] After updating settings to `"EUR"` (valid), a new checkout for a new appointment returns `currency` = `"EUR"`

---

## Payments (v5.3 — Summary Statistics)

### Auth

- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/summary` without Bearer token → 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/summary` with valid admin Bearer token → 200 OK

### Response shape

- [ ] Response body contains top-level integer fields: `totalCount`, `pendingCount`, `paidCount`, `failedCount`, `refundedCount`
- [ ] Response body contains `totalsByCurrency` array
- [ ] Each entry in `totalsByCurrency` has: `currency`, `pendingAmount`, `paidAmount`, `failedAmount`, `refundedAmount`, `totalAmount`
- [ ] Counts add up correctly: `pendingCount + paidCount + failedCount + refundedCount ≤ totalCount` (remaining are Cancelled)
- [ ] `totalsByCurrency` is sorted alphabetically by currency

### Currency safety

- [ ] If any payment has a blank or invalid currency, the endpoint does not crash
- [ ] Such payments appear under currency `"UNKNOWN"` in `totalsByCurrency`

### Date filters (optional)

- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/summary?fromDate=2025-01-01` → returns only payments created on or after 2025-01-01
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/summary?toDate=2025-12-31` → returns only payments created on or before 2025-12-31
- [ ] Both filters combined narrow the result correctly
- [ ] Omitting both filters returns stats for all payments

### No regressions

- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments` still returns the full payment list
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/{id}` still returns a single payment
- [ ] `PATCH /api/admin/payments/{id}/mark-paid` still works
- [ ] `PATCH /api/admin/payments/{id}/mark-failed` still works
- [ ] `PATCH /api/admin/payments/{id}/mark-refunded` still works
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` still creates a checkout session
- [ ] `GET /api/payments/{id}/status` still returns public payment status

### Provider identity

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with a valid `appointmentId` → 200, response `provider` = `"Manual"`
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/payments/{paymentId}` → `provider` field = `"Manual"` (no other provider is active)
- [ ] No real API key, external credential, or third-party call is required

### Checkout flow — still works end-to-end

- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` with valid `appointmentId` → 200, response contains `paymentId`, `checkoutUrl`, `status: "Pending"`
- [ ] `checkoutUrl` = `"http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}"` (Manual provider sets this)
- [ ] Calling `POST /api/payments/checkout` again with the same `appointmentId` → 200, same `paymentId` returned, idempotency message present, no duplicate payment created
- [ ] `GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status` → 200, returns `id`, `status: "Pending"`, `paidAt: null`

### simulate-paid still works

- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{paymentId}/simulate-paid` (Development only) → 200, `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` set
- [ ] After simulate-paid: `GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status` → `status: "Paid"`, `paidAt` set

## Swagger

- [ ] `GET /swagger` loads and displays all endpoints grouped by tag
- [ ] Clicking "Authorize" and pasting a valid Bearer token allows protected endpoints to succeed
- [ ] `Payments (Public)` tag shows: `GET /api/payments/{id}/status`, `POST /api/payments/checkout`, `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid`
- [ ] Swagger summary for `simulate-paid` reads "[DEV ONLY — Development environment only]" and states it returns 404 in other environments
